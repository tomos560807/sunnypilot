# within the lookahead, stand the shaper down (full stock decel) so it stops at the proper gap with no
# coast. Keyed on the PREDICTED speed reaching ~0 (covers lead AND light/sign stops), NOT raw ego speed

# accel ramp) and min(slewed,raw) lets the deep raw plan win, so the bite passes through untouched.
# Fix: jerk-limit the deepening with a DEPTH-PROPORTIONAL jerk
#   jerk(a) = ONSET_JERK0 + ONSET_JERK_GAIN * abs(a_current),  capped at ONSET_JERK_MAX
# At the bite (a~0) the jerk is ONSET_JERK0 (gentle); it grows with decel depth, so the decel magnitude
# follows da/dt = j0 + k*a  =>  a(t) = (j0/k)*(exp(k*t) - 1) -- the exponential-growth reference. The
# output is never deeper than the plan (only ever softer-or-equal during the bite) and converges to it.
# No velocity-debt feedback: it carried stale state across closely-spaced stop-and-go brakes and
# over-braked the next onset (verified). NORMAL omitted -> shaper never runs.

# softening modest (so it never feels like "no brakes"), an INSTANTANEOUS-gap catch-up adds jerk when
# realized lags the plan by more than ONSET_GAP_SOFT, hard-capped at ONSET_JERK_MAX. This uses the
# current accel gap only (no integrated state) so nothing carries across closely-spaced brakes. Steady
# softening then settles near ONSET_GAP_SOFT; the hard cap keeps the catch from ever being a grab.

# we don't soften ahead of one; (2) the fast hand-back (ONSET_HANDBACK_JERK) closes any open soft gap
